Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane, return the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.

 

Example 1:

Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: points = [[1,1],[3,2],[5,3],[4,1],[2,3],[1,4]]
Output: 4

 

Constraints:

    1 <= points.length <= 300
    points[i].length == 2
    -104 <= xi, yi <= 104
    All the points are unique.
